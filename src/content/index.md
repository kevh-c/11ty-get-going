It works!

Get Going is an 11ty starter project for simple blogs, small sites and prototypes. 

_Now upgraded to use ES6 modules and 11ty v3.0_ ðŸŽ‰

The following starting points and integrations come included:

{% include "partials/card-list-index.njk" %}

## Requirements

[Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended then simply `nvm use` and it will pull the version from the `.nvmrc` file in this repo. Any Node LTS version should suffice for this template.

### Running the project

To run a version yourself, [clone the repo](https://github.com/kevh-c/11ty-get-going), `npm install` and then `npm run serve` to view the demo project locally.

If you're intending to use Git LFS remember to `git lfs install` to enable it.
